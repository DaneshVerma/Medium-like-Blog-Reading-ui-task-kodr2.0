        "body": "## Introduction\nClosures are one of JavaScript's most powerful features. They allow functions to remember variables from their scope even after the scope has finished executing.\n\n---\n\n### How They Work\nA closure is created when:\n1. You define a function inside another function.\n2. The inner function references variables from the outer function.\n\n```js\nfunction outer() {\n  let count = 0;\n  return function inner() {\n    count++;\n    console.log(count);\n  }\n}\n\nconst counter = outer();\ncounter(); // 1\ncounter(); // 2\n```\n\nIn this example, `count` stays alive because the inner function keeps a reference to it.\n\n---\n\n### Why They’re Useful\n- **Data privacy**\n- **Stateful functions**\n- **Function factories**\n\n> \"Closures let you store state without polluting the global scope.\"\n\n---\n\n### Common Pitfalls\n- Memory leaks from unused closures.\n- Confusion with `this` context.\n\n**Tip:** Always clean up references if the closure is no longer needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\nClosures give you the ability to write modular, maintainable code. Once you understand them, you'll start seeing them everywhere!"

    "body": "## The Problem with Callbacks\n\nCallbacks can quickly lead to complex, hard-to-read code known as 'callback hell.' Promises and async/await address this problem by providing cleaner syntax and better error handling.\n\n### Promises Recap\n\nA Promise represents a future value or failure and supports chaining via `.then()` and `.catch()`. This improves asynchronous workflows but can still be verbose.\n\n### Async/Await Syntax\n\nIntroduced in ES2017, async/await allows asynchronous code to look synchronous, improving readability and debuggability.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nUse `try/catch` blocks with async functions to handle errors gracefully, keeping your code robust.\n\n### Real-world Usage\n\nAsync/await shines in API calls, file I/O, and sequential processing where readability is paramount.\n\nLearning async/await makes JavaScript asynchronous code easier to write and maintain."
